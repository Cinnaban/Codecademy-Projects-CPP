Fizz Buzz
Fizz Buzz is a classic developer interview question that is asked or referred to so often for so long, it is almost a clich√©!

Though this challenge will appear very simplistic to those with some coding experience, it is designed to weed out 99.5% programming job candidates who cannot creatively use their coding knowledge to solve simple problems.

Want to give it a shot?

Fizz Buzz
Write a fizzbuzz.cpp program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.

But for multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of 5, print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print, FizzBuzz.

int main() {
  for (int a = 1; a <=100; a++) {
    std::cout << a << "\n"; 
    /* If multiple of 3 = "Fizz"
       If multiple of 5 = "Buzz"
       If multiple of both 3 & 5 "FizzBuzz"
    */
    if ((a % 3 == 0) & (a % 5 == 0)) {
      std::cout << "FizzBuzz\n";
    } else if ((a % 3 == 0) & (a % 5 != 0)) {
      std::cout << "Fizz\n";
